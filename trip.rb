# Code your prompts here!

# First, puts out a string asking where the tourist would like to stay.
puts "Let's plan your trip! Where would you like to stay?"

# Then, set a variable called stay to get the user's input. Make sure to capitilize that input.

stay = gets.chomp.capitalize  #don't forget to Capitilize the input

# Do the same thing with `eats` and one last time with `nights`, capturing their text input and storing them to the respective local variable
puts "What do you want to eat?"
eat= gets.chomp
puts "How many nights are you staying?"
nights=gets.chomp

# Lastly, puts it all back by interpolating these values in a string.

puts "Woohoo! You are staying in #{stay} and eating #{eat}!! You are staying for #{nights} nights, so get out there and enjoy!"
